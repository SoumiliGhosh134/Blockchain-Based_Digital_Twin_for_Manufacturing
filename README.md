# Blockchain-Based Digital Twin for Manufacturing

## Project Description
This project involves creating a blockchain-powered digital twin system for factories. It ensures real-time tracking, secure data management, and transparent monitoring of manufacturing assets.

## Project Vision
The goal is to leverage blockchain technology to establish trust, security, and immutability for digital twins in a manufacturing environment. This system will streamline operations and enhance efficiency through decentralized asset management.

## Future Scope
- **AI Integration:** Adding predictive maintenance and performance optimization through AI models.
- **IoT Connectivity:** Real-time synchronization with IoT sensors for automatic updates.
- **Multi-Factory Support:** Extending support to multiple factories with independent digital twins.
- **Data Analytics Dashboard:** Providing intuitive dashboards for visualizing asset performance and status.

## Key Features
- **Asset Creation:** Create digital twins of factory assets with detailed metadata.
- **Status Updates:** Update digital twin status based on real-time operations.
- **Immutable Records:** Leverage blockchain for secure, immutable records of asset changes.
- **Asset Tracking:** Query asset details with timestamps for audit and validation.
- **Owner Authorization:** Restricted access to create and update twins to authorized users.
